# Table_Tripod
This project is documentation for a secure and durable table smartphone tripod that I was looking for and ultimately made.

# Backstory
During the pandemic, I was a junior (Electrical & Computer Engineering @ University of Missouri-Kansas City) looking for a secure and durable table tripod for my phone. Looking around on the market, I found the products on the unsatisfactory. Some were made with cheap materials while others were engineered to be fragile and eye appealing.

# Evolution
Here I will share the evolution of parts added and explain why I have evolved the design.

1: Genesis- I needed this tripod to meet these requirements:

      Be able to sit on the table
      
      Be able to grip my smartphone with a strong non-slip grip
      
      Be able to hold my phone in both poitrait & Landscape
      
      Be able to charge my phone while mounted
      
      Be portable enough to keep up with my ever changing environment

2: Something to look up to- The Table tripod was a great success... Except when I had my first video call.
      
      The Ball Head Tripod Mount tilted my phone to show my face in a video call and not just my shirt. 
      
      A feature that was inadvertantly discovered to be able to hold the the tripod while walking. 
      Now, I had a way to walk and watch the screen of my phone at the same time.
      
3: The upgrade- After some time of use and abuse (probably a year or two), The cellphone mount plastic cracked and broke.

      This is when I decided to look for more metalic parts to replace the plastic. 
      The mount I found was able to be that and a bit more:
          
          Spring loaded grip for quick release
          
          Side screws for poitrait and/or accessories
          
          Hot Shoe Mount for lighting or audio attachments
          
4: The plastic hand screw fails- The plastic head on the screw that locked the ball in place broke after a year's use.
      
      The metallic Ball Head Tripod Mount was designed for heavier cameras with:
      
            2 ball locking screws
            2 levels for perfect balance
            1 Quick Release sliding plate
